{"name":"Critique-on-graph","tagline":"","body":"# critique-on-graph\r\n## Graph Critique and Improvement\r\n\r\nI found [this](http://oaklandcac.pbworks.com/w/page/59627544/Facts%20About%20OUSD's%20Students%20with%20Disabilities) document on pbworks. The author summarized data from [California Department of Education database](http://data1.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/dataquest.asp) and revealed the facts about students with disabilities in 2011-2012 in order to improve education services to special education students in Oakland district in California.\r\n\r\nThe author used some Bar Charts to show the data. There are some improvements I suggested in my post, and based on which, I recreated some graphs.\r\n\r\n![funny](http://i.imgur.com/MiPIl.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this repository, I attached the original Rcoding, my post in pfd, Rmarkdown format, as well as html file. For html file,  it cannot show it there that is big, please view it by copying this address (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bell-Wang/critique-on-graph/gh-pages/test.html) in the query box inside [this page](http://htmlpreview.github.io)\r\nor open it by clicking \"screen button\" in the ribbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you!! :smiley:","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
