## Graph Critique and Improvement

I found [this](http://oaklandcac.pbworks.com/w/page/59627544/Facts%20About%20OUSD's%20Students%20with%20Disabilities) document on pbworks. The author summarized data from [California Department of Education database](http://data1.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/dataquest.asp) and revealed the facts about students with disabilities in 2011-2012 in order to improve education services to special education students in Oakland district in California.

The author used some Bar Charts to show the data. There are some improvements I suggested in my post, and based on which, I recreated some graphs.

In this repository, I attached the original Rcoding, my post in pfd, Rmarkdown format, as well as html file. For html file,  it cannot show it there that is big, please view it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bell-Wang/critique-on-graph/master/markdown.html) or open it by clicking "screen button" in the ribbon.
